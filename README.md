# PizzaRecipe
UofT Coding Bootcamp Project 2

Pizza Recipe is a full stack food app built to help you make use of the food in your kitchen. Tell us what ingredients you want to put on your pizza and it will list them for you. It will also count the calories in total from the toppings!

Project Team: Sunil, Bayli, Oleskii, Perry
